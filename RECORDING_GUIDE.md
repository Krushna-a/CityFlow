4. Play back and check levels (should peak around -6dB)

**Recording Process:**

2. Read entire script once (don't stop for mistakes)
3. If mistakes, pause 2 seconds and re-record that section
4. Maintain consistent volume
5. Don't eat/drink while recording
6. Speak clearly and at 150-160 wpm

**Post-Recording:**
1. Export as WAV (uncompressed)

3. Add fade in/fade out (500ms each)
4. Import into video editor

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too Fast**: Don't rush through demos. Pause between actions (2-3 seconds)
❌ **Jerky Cursor**: Move mouse smoothly, not erratically
❌ **Background Noise**: Record in quiet room, close window
❌ **Monotone Voice**: Vary your tone and pace, sound enthusiastic
❌ **Technical Jargon**: Explain like you're talking to non-technical people
❌ **Skip Steps**: Show every click, every animation, every loading screen
❌ **Miss the Modal**: The JOIN vs CREATE modal is critical—don't skip it
❌ **Low Audio**: Test audio levels before recording the whole thing
